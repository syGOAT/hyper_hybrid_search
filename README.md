# Hyper Hybrid Search Engine

Welcome to the Hyper Hybrid Search Engine, a next-generation search engine project designed to leverage the power of hybrid models and advanced embedding techniques to deliver superior search capabilities.

## Overview

The Hyper Hybrid Search Engine is a cutting-edge project that aims to revolutionize how we think about search technologies. By integrating a powerful embedding inference backend with a robust set of tools and interfaces, this project is designed to offer unparalleled search accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- **Embedding Inference Backend:** Utilizes advanced machine learning models to understand and interpret search queries at a deeper level.
- **Server Interface:** Provides a seamless and scalable API interface for handling search requests and responses.
- **Utility/Source Module:** A dedicated module (`utils` or `src`) for common utilities and source codes that support the core functionalities of the search engine.
- **Benchmarking:** Tools and protocols to measure the performance of the search engine under various conditions and workloads.
- **Application:** End-user applications showcasing the capabilities and use cases of the search engine.
- **Database:** A robust database system designed to store, manage, and retrieve vast amounts of data efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Any modern web browser for accessing the application interface

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourorganization/hyper-hybrid-search-engine.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Setup the database (see the database configuration section).
4. Start the server:
   ```
   python server/start_server.py
   ```

### Quick Start

After installation, you can quickly test the search engine by sending a search query to the server's REST API:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/search -d '{"query": "your search query"}'
```
