Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2-substituted benzothiazoles from N-acyl 1,2-aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water 鈥?due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthus mechanism 鈥?provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80 kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250 kJ/mol for the second.

Photovoltaic devices based on perovskite single crystals are emerging as a viable alternative to polycrystalline materials. Perovskite single crystals indeed possess lower trap state densities, higher carrier mobilities, and longer diffusion lengths, and potentially can achieve higher performance with respect to those fabricated with polycrystalline films, although their integration in a complete device needs particular attention and the use of specifically tailored growth techniques. In this review, recent advances on single-crystal halide perovskites are reported. First, crystalline structure and fundamental properties of 3D perovskites are discussed, including the emerging mixed-anion cation perovskites, and then the most popular growth methods with a focus on techniques that enable the implementation in photovoltaic devices are presented. Architectures and materials used to produce lateral and vertical solar cells are further introduced and recent improvements in device design and fabrication are summarized. Finally, the strategies used to solve the still open challenge on these materials regarding stability under environmental conditions are critically discussed and the view on the opportunities offered by halide perovskites is reflected.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

While the two-step method leads to regular perovskite film crystallization, engineering wider bandgaps (Eg > 1.65 eV) for the solution-based two-step method remains a challenge. This work introduces an effective and facile strategy to increase the bandgap of two-step solution-processed perovskite films by incorporating bromide in both deposition steps, the inorganic precursor deposition (step 1, PbBr2) and the organic precursor deposition (step 2, FABr). This strategy yields improved charge carrier extraction and quasi-Fermi level splitting with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 15.9%. Further improvements are achieved by introducing CsI in the bulk and utilizing LiF as surface passivation, resulting in a stable power output exceeding 18.5% for Eg = 1.68 eV. This additional performance boost arises from enhanced perovskite film crystallization, leading to improved charge carrier extraction. Laboratory scale monolithic perovskite/silicon solar cells (TSCs) (1 cm2 active area) achieve PCEs up to 23.7%.

Metformin, a clinical drug used worldwide, has been found to have a novel role in inducing tumor pyroptosis, which in turn promotes tumor to releases inflammatory substances and improve tumor immunogenicity. Nevertheless, it requires a higher dosage for cancer treatment compared to conventional chemotherapy medications, thereby exhibiting pronounced side effects. Within the context of this specific study, we developed a pH-responsive nanocarrier (MT NPs) that can simultaneously deliver metformin as a pyroptosis inducer and Toripalimab as an anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1 monoclonal antibody for the purpose of cancer immunotherapy. Once the nanodrugs reached the acidic tumor microenvironment, their structures were degraded due to hydrophilic transformation caused by segment protonation. Furthermore, the MT NPs released the metformin and Toripalimab to synergistically promote tumor immunity, resulting in significantly improved therapeutic outcomes, potentially leading to successful tumor eradication.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To address this, a silver-induced absorption red-shifted core-shell nano-particle is developed, and surface-modified with triphenylphosphonium bromide (TPP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) to obtain a novel nanodiagnosis-treatment agent (Ag@CuS-TPP@HA). This diagnosis-treatment agent can dual-targets cancer cells and mitochondria, and exhibits maximal light absorption at 1064\\xa0nm, thereby enhancing nesr-infrared II (NIR-II) photoacoustic (PA) signal and photothermal effects under 1064\\xa0nm laser irradiation. Additionally, the silver in Ag@CuS-TPP@HA can catalyze the Fenton-like reactions with H2O2 in the tumor tissue, yielding reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS production, coupled with enhanced photothermal effects, instigates immunogenic cell death (ICD), leading to a substantial release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and damage-associated molecular patterns, which have improved the tumor immune suppression microenvironment and boosting immune checkpoint blockade therapy, thus stimulating a systemic antitumor immune response. Hence, Ag@CuS-TPP@HA, as a cancer diagnostic-treatment agent, not only accomplishes targeted the NIR-II PA imaging of tumor tissue and addresses the challenge of accurate diagnosis of deep cancer tissue in vivo, but it also leverages ROS/photothermal therapy to enhance immune checkpoint blockade, thereby eliminating primary tumors and effectively inhibiting distant tumor growth.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]"
